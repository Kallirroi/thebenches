        <p>A theme that is clear and shared across many of the speakers’ work we’ve encountered this semester is that personal interactions and the stories that are mediated through them, are extremely powerful in shaping people’s identities and motives. In particular, Kathy Cramer’s work encourages us to think about the ways in which stories and storytelling allow groups to build unity while simultaneously acknowledging difference. This is especially relevant to polarization in the current politics of the USA, as we seem to be losing the ability to listen to the “other” and to acknowledge the multitudes of opinions, across geographical and socioeconomic differences. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>To this end, we designed, built, and hope to enact an intervention that will promote the listening to and creation of personal stories across geographic spaces. </p>  	</div>
